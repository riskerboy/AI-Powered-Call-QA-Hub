# Call Center QA Agent

A comprehensive web-based application for automated quality assurance evaluation of call center recordings. This tool helps call center managers and QA teams efficiently review and assess agent performance through AI-powered transcription and evaluation.

## üéØ Purpose

The Call Center QA Agent is designed to streamline the quality assurance process for call centers, particularly those handling Final Expense campaigns. It automates the transcription of call recordings and provides AI-powered evaluations based on established QA criteria.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality
- **Audio Transcription**: Automatically transcribes call recordings using Deepgram API
- **AI-Powered Evaluation**: Evaluates calls using OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo based on comprehensive QA criteria
- **User Management**: Secure login and registration system with user-specific data storage
- **Dashboard Analytics**: Real-time performance metrics and employee analytics
- **Excel Integration**: Import/export call data via Excel files

### QA Evaluation Criteria
The system evaluates calls based on 12 key criteria:

1. **DNC Status**: Detects Do Not Call (DNC) violations
2. **Customer Tone Analysis**: Identifies customer sentiment (polite, abusive, frustrated, neutral)
3. **No Call List Compliance**: Flags customers who mention being on no-call lists
4. **DNC Indicators**: Analyzes context for potential DNC situations
5. **Agent Pushiness**: Evaluates if agents are overly aggressive or interrupting
6. **Licensed Agent Requests**: Flags when customers request licensed agent transfers
7. **Multiple Calls Complaints**: Identifies customers who mention receiving multiple calls
8. **Customer Name Validation**: Checks for inappropriate or abusive customer names
9. **Agent Conduct**: Verifies proper microphone usage and English-only communication
10. **Professionalism**: Assesses agent tone and delivery quality
11. **Compliance**: Evaluates script adherence and legal standards
12. **Effectiveness**: Measures call success and sales approach
